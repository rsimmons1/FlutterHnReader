# HN Reader

HnReader is a Flutter based Hackernews client with the following features:
- Dark mode
- Story caching

It requires no additional permissions and currently does not support commenting only reading.

The goal of the project is to look and act as closely to the original Hackernews page as possible and add small features like dark mode and story caching while being cross platform.
